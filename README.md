# Daily-Planner

This application is actually called "Tabula Rasa", Latin for "a blank slate." It is available here: https://preussenfahrer.github.io/Daily-Planner/.

The user is prompted to place their objectives for the day into the text box, which is highlighted with grey (for past), red (for present), or green (for future). They would then be able to save these tasks and view them at the end of the day.
